    <h3>Intention Network</h3>
    <h4>Ecosystem for robot control</h4>
    <p>
        Through a network of intentions, devices can communicate with users and with each other.<br/>
        When a device needs to interact with the outside world, it creates an <b>Intention</b><br/>
        <b>Intention</b> is the need to provide or receive a service.<br/>
        It is broadcasts between devices for search of devices with counter intentions.<br/>
        Once a device with a counter intention is found, the negotiation process begins. Each of the devices accepts
        or rejects the counter intention. If the intention is accepted on both sides, a data link is established
        and the devices can communicate with each other<br/>
