  <h3>Intention Network</h3>
  <h4>Ecosystem for robots</h4>
  <p>
    The Intention Network is a decentralized peer-to-peer system that enables devices to communicate directly using
    Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    radio channels, IR ports, or even voice commands. Each device in the network can store and retransmit an intention
    until a device capable of fulfilling that intention is found.
    This makes it possible for autonomous devices to operate in environments without a stable internet connection.
  </p>

  <h4>How does the Intention Network work?</h4>
  <p>
    In the Intention Network, we begin by creating an <b>Intention</b> — a request or an offer.
    The intention is broadcast among devices until one with the opposite intention is discovered.
    Once a match is found, a data channel is established, allowing the devices to communicate directly.    
  </p>

<h4>Live Example</h4>
<p>
  Picture yourself strolling along the riverside. Your personal drone, Berrimor, follows close behind.
  The sound of its propellers makes it impossible to hear you directly — but in your pocket, your phone Sophocles is
  listening.
</p>

<p>
  You say: <i>“Berrimor, order me a coffee.”</i>
</p>

<p>
  Sophocles instantly creates an <b>Intention</b>:
  <b>"Owner, Sophocles, Berrimor, Money → Coffee"</b>, and passes it on to Berrimor.
  Berrimor retransmits the request and scans for nearby devices.
</p>

<p>
  Soon, it finds a robotic coffee point — Coffee Maker 1001 — which broadcasts the opposite intention:
  <b>"Coffee → Money"</b>.
  The two devices connect, compare intentions, and start the negotiation process.
</p>

<p>
  They exchange menus, agree on the order (a latte), and establish a secure private channel.
  Coordinates are synchronized, payment is reserved, and status updates flow in real time as the coffee is prepared.
</p>

<p>
  When the drink is ready, Coffee Maker 1001 sends Berrimor the exact pickup location.
  Berrimor retrieves the coffee, finalizes the transaction, and flies back to you — mission completed, latte in hand.
