  <h3>Intention Network</h3>
  <h4>Ecosystem for robots</h4>
  <p>
    Have you ever wanted to say to your fridge, "Hey, you're overcooling milk"?<br />
    Or ask him: "Do I have any cheese left?"<br />
    Say to the washing machine, "Wash these cloths delicately"<br />
    Ask for a kettle: "heat the water for tea"<br />
    Let's imagine how it can be technically implemented. First you need to equip the refrigerator with a microphone and
    voice recognition system.
    Voice recognition today requires a lot of computing resources. Connect it to the cloud? Connect all devices to the
    cloud?<br />
    Few people like to broadcast everything that happens in your home to unknown servers.
    If there is no Internet, the entire infrastructure becomes useless. Even if you make sure that each
    device has its own connection to the cloud then how will they interact with each other?<br />
    <br />
    A network of intentions overcomes these concerns.<br />
    <br />
    All devices in the intention network can communicate with each other directly without an external Internet
    connection.<br />
    If only one device can recognize voice, all devices can do it.
    It can be your phone, with cloud speech recognition. It will broadcasts data to cloud only if you use it. Or it can
    be
    your home computer with microphone and offline recognition system.

  <h4>How Intention Network works?</h4>
  <p>
    In the Intention network we begin by creating a <b>Intention</b> - a wish to give or take something.
    It will broadcast amongst devices until device with the opposite intention is found.
    Then data channel would be established and devices can communicate.
